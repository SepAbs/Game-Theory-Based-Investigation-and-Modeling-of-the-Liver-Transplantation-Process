# Game-Theory-Based-Investigation-and-Modeling-of-the-Liver-Transplantation-Process
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To explore how game theory can model and optimize the liver transplantation process, focusing on decision-making dynamics between donors, recipients, and medical authorities. The goal was to analyze fairness, efficiency, and ethical balance through theoretical modeling and structured scientific writing.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

LaTeX â€“ for professional academic writing and mathematical notation

Beamer â€“ for presentation formatting and visual communication

Xepersian â€“ for Persian text typesetting and localization support

ðŸ“Š Results

Produced a semi-formal research paper collaboratively with two classmates, presenting a structured framework that applies game-theoretic models to the transplantation decision process. The project improved our understanding of strategic modeling in biomedical systems and strengthened our academic writing and LaTeX composition skills.
